# Docker Containers
## Check versions of Docker Client & Engine
`$ docker version`  
*returns the version of your client and the server, also called the engine.*

`$ docker info`  
*shows most configuration values for the engine.*

## Image vs. Container
`Image`  
*An image is the application we want to run. It consists of the binaries and libraries that make up your application.*

`Container`  
*A Container is a running instance of an image.  You can have many containers running off the same image.*

## Docker Command Line Structure
The typical docker command line structure is as follows:  
`docker <command> <sub-command> (options)`  

**Typical Commands:**
```
$ docker container run
```
